# AWS Lambda

- AWS Lambda is basically a virtual function, therefore there is no need to manage any servers.
- They are designed for shorter executions and can be run on demand.
- Lambda scales automatically based on the demand.

## Lambda Features

- Easily integrates with the entire AWS stack.
- Lambda functions can be defined using popular programming languages (Node.Js & Python3).
- Lambda functions can be easily monitored using CloudWatch.
- RAM per function could be increased to 1.5GB.
- An increase in RAM would also improve the performance of the CPU and network.

## Lambda Pricing

- Charged per request and the compute time consumed.
- Free tier: 1 million Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time.
